# Scala.meta 1.7.0


## Upgrade guide

Contrib:
- `equal` has been renamed to `isEqual` to avoid accidentally using `equals`,
  which always compiles but does the wrong thing at runtime.
- `isEqual` defaults to structual equality, so it's not longer necessary to
  write `[Structurally]` in `a.isEqual[Structurally](b)`.
- `(a: Subtype).isEqual(b: Supertype)` will no longer compile, either upcast
  `a: Supertype` or swap the order to `b.isEqual(a)`
  
## `contrib`
- The `Extract[A, B]` typeclass has been added.
  - This means that you can extract Stats/Mods/Annotations/Defs.
  - More information about this will be in the tutorial
  - More use-cases for Extract are in the pipeline, follow #741 for more details
